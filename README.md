# Cat vs Dog Classification with CNN üê±üê∂

This repository contains a deep learning project that classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was trained on labeled image data to achieve accurate and efficient binary classification.

## Features
- **Model Architecture**: A custom CNN architecture designed for binary image classification.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping were applied to improve model generalization.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are used to evaluate model performance.
- **Training Framework**: Implemented using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, specify depending on your project).

## Project Overview
1. **Dataset**: The model was trained on the [Dogs vs Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) from Kaggle.
2. **Model**: A CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.
3. **Preprocessing**: Images were resized to a uniform size (e.g., 128x128) and normalized for optimal training.
4. **Training**: Optimized using [specific optimizer, e.g., Adam] with a learning rate of [value].
5. **Results**: The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tashbaevb/cnn.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the training script:

4. Test the model on new images:

## Results
- **Accuracy**: 88%

## Future Work
- Extend to multiclass classification for other animal species.
- Experiment with transfer learning using pretrained models like VGG16, ResNet, etc.
